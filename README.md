The Expense Tracker application is a comprehensive tool designed to help users manage their financial 
activities effortlessly. This project combines the power of a console-based application with a graphical user 
interface (GUI) for enhanced usability. The console application offers functionalities such as user registration 
and login, expense tracking, budget management, and report generation. Users can efficiently record their 
expenses, set budgets for different categories, and generate insightful reports to analyze their financial 
activities. To enhance user experience, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented using Java 
Swing. The GUI provides a user-friendly environment with options for logging in, registering a new user, 
adding expenses, viewing expenses, and deleting user profiles. The Expense Tracker project seamlessly 
integrates these components, offering users a versatile and accessible platform to manage their finances 
effectively. Whether through the console or the graphical interface, users can easily track expenses, set 
budgets, and gain valuable insights into their financial habits.
